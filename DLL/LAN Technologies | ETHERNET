:#LAN Technologies | ETHERNET:
  
  
  The connection among the devices could be wired or wireless. Ethernet, Token Ring and Wireless LAN using IEEE 802.11 
  are examples of standard LAN technologies.
  
  Ethernet :-
            IEEE standards 802.3. 
            The reason behind its wide usability is Ethernet is easy to understand, implement, maintain and allows 
            low-cost network implementation. 
            Ethernet operates in two layers of the OSI model, Physical Layer, and Data Link Layer.
            For Ethernet, the protocol data unit is Frame since we mainly deal with DLL.
            In order to handle collision, the Access control mechanism used in Ethernet is CSMA/CD.
            
             Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as Token Ring, FDDI and ARCNET. 
             
             Ethernet data transfer rates have been increased from the original 2.94 megabits per second (Mbit/s) to the
             latest 400 gigabits per second (Gbit/s).
             
             Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called frames.
             Each frame contains source and destination addresses, and error-checking data so that damaged
             frames can be detected and discarded; most often, higher-layer protocols trigger retransmission of lost frames. 
             
             
              Manchester Encoding Technique is used in Ethernet.
              
              
               In both Manchester Encoding and Differential Manchester, Encoding Baud rate is double of bit rate.

               Baud rate = 2* Bit rate
